Package: wiringpi
Section: misc
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: WiringPi consists of libraries written in C to access
 Raspberry PI GPIO pins. It also includes a utility named gpio to access
 and manipulate the GPIO pins.
 .
 This package provides the gpio command line utility.

Package: libwiringpi
Section: libs
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: The wiringpi libraries, headers and gpio command
 Libraries to allow GPIO access on a Raspberry Pi from C and C++
 and BASIC programs as well as from the command-line
 .
 This package contains the shared library libwiringpi linked against
 glibc.

Package: libwiringpidev
Section: libs
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: The devLib is a set of library routines implemented using
 wiringpi to give you easy access to some popular peripherals. Devices
 supported include character LCD displays (based on the Hitachi HD44780U
 chips), and graphical ones – e.g. the common 128×64 pixel displays with
 the generic 12864H driver chip. The DS1302 RTC clock chip, sensors based
 on the Maxdetect chips (e.g. RHT003) the Gertboard and PiFace interface
 boards and so on.
 .
 This package contains the shared library libwiringpidev linked against
 glibc.

Package: libwiringpi-dev
Section: libdevel
Architecture: any
Depends: libwiringpi (= ${binary:Version}), ${misc:Depends}
Description: The wiringpi libraries, headers and gpio command
 Libraries to allow GPIO access on a Raspberry Pi from C and C++
 and BASIC programs as well as from the command-line
 .
 This package contains the static library libwiringpi.a and headers for
 libwiringpi.
